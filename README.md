Meta-Learning for Autonomous Machine Learning Project

Overview

Meta-Learning for Autonomous Machine Learning is a project aimed at developing algorithms that automatically adapt machine learning models to new tasks with minimal human intervention. The project explores meta-learning techniques to train models that learn how to learn, enabling faster adaptation to new data or tasks.

The repository contains code implementations of various meta-learning techniques and experiments that illustrate how these methods can be applied in autonomous machine learning scenarios.

Features

Task-Agnostic Meta-Learning (TAML): Trains models capable of solving new tasks without task-specific fine-tuning.
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML): General meta-learning framework to adapt models to new tasks with only a few gradient steps.
Few-Shot Learning: Enables learning models to perform well on tasks with limited training data.
Automatic Hyperparameter Optimization: Automated tuning of model hyperparameters to improve learning efficiency.
Online Meta-Learning: Models that adapt continuously as new data arrives
